I am an American who married a Canadian and immigrated to Canada in 2012.
The Canadian Immigration documentation leaves a bit to be desired so, during
the process, I produced a guide to help myself.  This is that guide.

Please note that **I am not a lawyer** and that **this guide is not comprehensive**
and **may be out of date**.  Simply stated, check the official documentation from
the Canadian Government website before submitting your application.
