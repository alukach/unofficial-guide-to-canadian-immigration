<li>Your own doctor cannot do the medical examination. You must see a physician on Canadaâ€™s list of <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/dmp-md/medical.aspx">Panel Physicians</a>.  <em>Pro-tip: In my experience, this was cheaper if done in Canada</em>

<h3>
<a name="eligibility-review" class="anchor" href="#eligibility-review"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Eligibility Review:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The visa office will process your application and decide if a visa may be issued to you and your family members. The visa office may require:

<ul>
<li>An Interview: If you need to be interviewed, the visa office will notify you in writing in advance of the date, time and location of the interview as well as of the documents to bring with you.

<ul>
<li>You, your spouse or common-law partner may be asked to come to the interview. The visa officer may ask, among others, about your:

<ul>
<li>relationship to the sponsor</li>
<li>education,</li>
<li>reasons for emigrating</li>
<li>plans and preparations</li>
<li>family</li>
<li>your health</li>
<li>your financial situation</li>
<li>past difficulties with the law</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional medical tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you and your sponsor meet all immigration requirements, the visa office will:

<ul>
<li>request you to submit passports</li>
<li>issue permanent resident visas to you and your family members accompanying you to Canada.</li>
<li>You must then arrive in Canada either with or before your family members, and within the validity period of the visas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>Note: The applications for both sponsorship and permanent residence should be filled out and sent at the same time.</p>

<h2>
<a name="fun-facts" class="anchor" href="#fun-facts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fun Facts:</h2>

<ul>
<li>As of October 25, 2012, CIC requires the sponsored spouse or partner to cohabit in a conjugal relationship with their sponsor for a period of two years after the day on which they became a permanent resident.</li>
<li>Reason to be refused: the relationship between you and your family members is not genuine or has been entered into for immigration purposes only. For example, you married or entered into a common-law or conjugal partner relationship primarily to obtain permanent residence in Canada;</li>
<li>Permanent resident status: If your application is successful, you and your family members will receive permanent resident visas. You will become permanent residents of Canada when you move to Canada within the validity of your visa(s). Some conditions will apply:

<ul>
<li>You will remain a permanent resident until you become a Canadian citizen, as long as you spend at least two years of each five-year period in Canada.</li>
<li>You may leave and re-enter Canada as often as you wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Residency obligations: Permanent residents may leave and re-enter Canada as often as they wish to settle their affairs or to travel. But, at the time they re-enter Canada, they must prove that they have been physically present for at least 730 days within five years, starting from the day they became permanent residents.

<ul>
<li>If you have been a permanent resident - For 5 years or more:

<ul>
<li>Then you must have accumulated 730 days of physical presence in Canada within the 5 years preceding the date you re-enter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have been a permanent resident - For less than 5 years

<ul>
<li>Then you must either have accumulated 730 days or will be able to have the required physical presence within 5 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
